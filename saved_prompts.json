Use this HTML template:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>[Insert chapter or topic title]</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            line-height: 1.6;\n            color: #333;\n            max-width: 800px;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        h1, h2, h3 {\n            color: #2c3e50;\n        }\n        .key-concept, .important-definition, .main-theory, .key-point {\n            background-color: #f0f0f0;\n            padding: 10px;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            margin: 10px 0;\n        }\n        .key-concept { background-color: #e6f3ff; }\n        .important-definition { background-color: #e6ffe6; }\n        .main-theory { background-color: #fff2e6; }\n        .key-point { background-color: #f0e6ff; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n[Insert content here]\n</body>\n</html>\n\n2. Organize the content by chapters or major topics using h1 tags, with subtopics using h2 and h3 tags.\n\n3. Use these div classes to highlight essential information:\n   - key-concept: Emphasize fundamental ideas central to the topic\n   - important-definition: Highlight crucial terms and their definitions as given in the book\n   - main-theory: Summarize major ethical theories or frameworks discussed\n   - key-point: List important facts, arguments, or conclusions\n\n4. Focus solely on information presented in the textbook. Do not add external examples or explanations.\n\n5. Summarize content concisely, prioritizing points most likely to be examined.\n\n6. Include all important terms, theories, and concepts mentioned in the book, even if only briefly.\n\n7. If the book presents step-by-step processes or lists, include these in full.\n\n8. Maintain the original structure and order of topics as presented in the textbook.\n\n9. If certain points are emphasized or repeated in the book, ensure these are included in the summary.\n\n10. Include any diagrams, charts, or tables that are central to understanding key concepts, describing them briefly.\n\n11. Note any sections the book marks as particularly important or summary sections, as these often indicate exam-relevant material.\n\n12. If the book includes review questions or key points at the end of chapters, incorporate these into your summary.\n\n13. Stick to the facts and theories as presented in the book, avoiding interpretation or additional commentary.\n\nAlways create a complete HTML document following these guidelines, covering all major topics in the textbook concisely but comprehensively.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: JUST WRITE THE HTML CODE, NOTHING ELSE, NO INTRODUCTION. JUST THE CODE", "ethics 2": "Summarize the ethics textbook content in a simple HTML format. Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Use this basic HTML structure:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>[Insert chapter or topic title]</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            line-height: 1.6;\n            color: #333;\n            max-width: 800px;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        h1, h2, h3 {\n            color: #2c3e50;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n[Insert content here]\n</body>\n</html>\n\n2. Replace [Topic] with the specific chapter or section title from the textbook.\n\n3. Break down the content under the main <h1> using <h2> tags for major subtopics.\n\n4. Use <h3> tags for further subtopics if necessary.\n\n5. Present key points as bullet points using <ul> and <li> tags.\n\n6. Include only information from the textbook. Do not add external examples or explanations.\n\n7. Focus on the most important concepts, definitions, theories, and arguments.\n\n8. Keep explanations brief and to the point.\n\n9.

If referencing specific pages or sections, include these in parentheses, e.g., (p. 45) or (Section 3.2).\n\nCreate a complete HTML document that summarizes the major textbook topics concisely, suitable for quick review before an exam. Each summary should be a self-contained HTML document focusing on a specific topic or chapter.\n\nIMPORTANT: JUST WRITE THE HTML CODE, NOTHING ELSE LIKE AN INTRODUCTION OR OTHER TEXT. JUST THE HTML"}
